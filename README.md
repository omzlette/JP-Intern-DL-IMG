# Image Classification with ConvNeXt

<hr>

This repository is for all codes and documents I made during internship period at Kanazawa University.

I was tasked to fine-tune <b>ConvNeXt</b> (an improvement over traditional CNN using Transformers building and training methods) to make it compatible with image classification task.  
The dataset I was tasked with is CIFAR-100.

Additionally, 1 week before finishing the internship, the lab members said I should try using Swin Transformers as well.  
However, because it was only 1 week before the end of internship, I couldn't research about it in time.
