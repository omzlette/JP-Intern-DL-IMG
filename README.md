# Image Classification with ConvNeXt

Written by: Tharnarch Thoranisttakul (Omz) [タナット トラニスタクン]（オム）  
This repository is for all codes and documents I made during internship period at Kanazawa University.

I was tasked to fine-tune <b>ConvNeXt</b> (an improvement over traditional CNN using Transformers building and training methods) to make it compatible with image classification task.  
The dataset I was tasked with is <b>CIFAR-100</b>.

Additionally, 1 week before finishing the internship, the lab members said I should try using Swin Transformers as well.  
However, because it was only 1 week before the end of internship, I couldn't research about it in time.

The code is located at ~/ConvNeXt/cleancode.ipynb  
I also made a summary for the research paper of ConvNeXt located at ~/ConvNeXt/Paper/ConvNeXt-summary.txt
